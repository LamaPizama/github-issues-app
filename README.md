# Github Issues App

Github issues application reproduced "pixel perfect way"

Requirements:
✅ template needs to have all essential elements like: sidebar, navigation with filters, main frame with issues list, OSX buttons
✅ filter buttons in navigation should have hover and active state
✅ the star in single issue bar needs to be clikable and change it’s state after click (as it is in design)
